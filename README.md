### Assignment: From PoorRail to RichRail
We were given a JavaFX application (PoorRail) and are expected to recreate this application using our newly learned design pattern and software architecture skills.
We used Maven to build our application with the necessary libraries.
* A simplified domain model can be found within this repository.

### Expectations:
* Commandline interface a.k.a. CLI (we achieved this using JavaFX and [Antlr](https://www.antlr.org/))
* A user-friendly interface a.k.a GUI (we achieved this using JavaFX)
